# Ship web viewer

Shipyard is a kind of chaos. Web viewer is attempt to direct all from one point. No install, no files, no versions just click the link and see.

## Intro

When building a ship or something large, thereâ€™s typically a 3D model with attributes. Usually, these models can take up a lot of gigabytes. Is there a way to transfer the model over the network and display it in a browser? As far as I know, Chrome can address up to 16GB per tab, also need a way to package a mesh data. This model of a 120 meter vessel takes up about 6GB of memory, packed into 500 MB.

## Basic Tools

Rust - philosophy to do it right. </br>
WGPU - The brilliant cross-platform, safe, pure-Rust graphics API.</br>
WINIT - for window handling.</br>
wasm-pack - to move all to WebAssembly.</br>
Angular - to stay on static typing (other project)

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests!


Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.
